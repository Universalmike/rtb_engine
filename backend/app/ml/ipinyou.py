"""Serve the CTR model trained on the iPinYou auction logs.

Exported by notebooks/ipinyou-replay.ipynb as plain JSON and scored here in
pure stdlib math, like the Avazu model: a weighted sum, a sigmoid, then the
isotonic calibration fitted on the notebook's tune day. tests/test_ipinyou_parity.py
rescores every request in the replay sample and must match the notebook.

This model needs the features of an iPinYou bid request (its exchanges,
regions, domains and user segments), which a visitor typing a URL into the
simulator does not have. So it scores the replayed real requests; the live
simulator keeps the Avazu model, whose features any request can supply.
